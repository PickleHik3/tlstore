#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Host tests for dist/tlstore (source engine/tlstore). No framework: a sandbox
# HOME, a fake prefix, a catalog whose sources are file:// URLs, and a list of
# assertions. Nothing here touches the network, a device or the real HOME.
#
#   scripts/test.sh [shell...]
#
# With no arguments it runs the whole suite under every POSIX shell it can find
# (sh, dash, busybox sh, bash --posix) — tlstore has to work under all of them,
# and dash is what Termux's sh is. Name shells to run only those, e.g.
#   scripts/test.sh /bin/dash "/path/to/busybox sh"
#
# Two knobs let the suite exercise phone-only code paths on a Linux host, and
# tlstore reads both by design:
#   TLSTORE_ARCH=aarch64   — binary and npm-musl items are hidden on other
#                            processors; the fixture sets this so they show up.
#   TLSTORE_PATCHELF=true  — the npm-musl install runs patchelf on the
#                            downloaded executable. The fixture payload is a
#                            shell script, so patchelf would (rightly) refuse
#                            it; `true` stands in and the rest of the path —
#                            registry document, sha512, extraction, loader,
#                            wrapper — is exercised for real. Nothing else is
#                            stubbed: curl, sha256sum, sha512sum, tar, base64,
#                            od and minisign are the real tools.
#   TLSTORE_ASSUME_TTY=1   — the questions tlstore only asks a person (replace
#                            this config file? remove the build tools?) are
#                            skipped when stdin is not a terminal. The suite has
#                            no pty, so it sets this knob and pipes the answers
#                            in; without it the "nobody is there" paths are what
#                            get tested, and both are.
#   TLSTORE_HOST=launcher  — which app the store is running in. The suite also
#                            drives the detection itself, through TERM_PROGRAM,
#                            TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION and the marker file the app
#                            writes, and checks all three.
#   TLSTORE_UI=no-such-ui  — the tlstore-ui binary bare `tlstore` execs inside
#                            the launcher. There is no pty here, so the suite
#                            never actually execs one; it points this at a
#                            fake executable to prove the routing decision, and
#                            at a name that is not there for the fallback.
#   TLSTORE_GITHUB         — where GitHub is: the suite points it at a file://
#                            tree laid out <host>/<path>, so `tlstore readme`
#                            and `readme-asset` fetch real files through real
#                            curl and never reach the network.
#   TLSTORE_RELEASE_BASE   — where the newest store release is (tlstore, its
#                            signature, tlstore-ui-<abi>). Every run points it
#                            at a file:// directory: one that is not there, so
#                            no ordinary test ever fetches a release, or one of
#                            the fixture releases the self-update tests lay out.
#   TLSTORE_BINARIES_RELEASES, TLSTORE_BINARIES_RAW — where a bare
#                            `binaries:<asset>@<tag>` source (a release asset)
#                            and a `binaries:<path>@<tag>` source (a file in
#                            the repository) resolve; file:// trees laid out
#                            <tag>/<asset>-aarch64 and <tag>/<path>.
# The catalog signature tests need minisign. Without it they are skipped, and
# the suite says so instead of passing quietly.
