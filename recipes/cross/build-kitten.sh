# build-kitten.sh — cross-compile kitty's `kitten` client for Android (arm64, or amd64 with
# TL_GOARCH=amd64) from a Linux host.
#
# `kitten` is the standalone Go half of kitty. It is what programs shell out to for `kitten icat`,
# and it is not packaged for Termux. It is CGO-free, so the cross-build itself is trivial; the
# awkward part is that kitty's *_generated.go files are gitignored and are emitted by a script that
# only runs under a built kitty. That is what the `./dev.sh build` step below is for — it downloads
# a self-contained prebuilt dependency bundle, so no system development packages are required.
#
# The target must be android/arm64. A linux/arm64 static build looks more attractive — it is what
# upstream publishes and what makes `kitten update-self` work — but it dies on Android:
#
#   SIGSYS: bad system call
#   syscall.faccessat2(...) -> os/exec.findExecutable -> imaging/magick.init
#
# Go's os/exec.LookPath reaches for faccessat2 on GOOS=linux, and Android's seccomp filter kills
# the process for using it. kitten's ImageMagick detection runs LookPath during package init, so
# every subcommand dies before doing anything. Device-verified on Android 16 (2026-08-16):
# linux/arm64 crashes on `kitten icat`, android/arm64 renders correctly.
#
# Cost of the android build: it is a PIE bound to /system/bin/linker64 rather than a static
# binary, and `kitten update-self` will 404 because upstream publishes no android asset.
#
# Requires: Go (see kitty's go.mod for the minimum), python3, git, and network access.
