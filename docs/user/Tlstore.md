# Tlstore

Tlstore is the launcher's own package manager for the tools and configs it shows off but does not
ship in the APK. The app puts `tlstore` in place for you, along with the shorter `tl` and `tls`, so
all three names run the same store.

## Quick start

```sh
tlstore install fish-shell
```

installs the whole fish setup in one go: fish, a prompt that follows your wallpaper colors, a nicer
`ls`, faster directory jumping, and a couple of plugins. From there, install everything else with:

```sh
tlstore install
```

which opens a picker over every item you do not have yet.

## What's in the store

Ten items, and each one brings whatever it needs along with it.

| item | what you get |
| --- | --- |
| `btop` | A resource monitor with the whole phone in view — every process, disk and network interface — run as the shell user through Shizuku. Launcher only. |
| `claude-code` | [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Anthropic's coding agent for the terminal. About 200 MB. |
| `codex` | [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), OpenAI's coding agent for the terminal, as built for Android by [codex-termux](https://github.com/DioNanos/codex-termux). About 275 MB. |
| `dawn` | A writing pad for the terminal: your markdown takes shape as you type, headings and all. |
| `fastfetch` | System information beside an animated logo. It brings the layout; drop any GIF of yours at `~/Pictures/gif/skel.gif` and it plays there, otherwise you get text. |
| `fish-shell` | The fish shell with the launcher's setup: the wallpaper prompt, `eza`, `zoxide`, and the plugins below. |
| `kitten` | Kitty's companion tool, for showing images and sending files from the terminal. |
| `opencode` | [opencode](https://opencode.ai), an open source coding agent for the terminal. About 200 MB. |
| `sigye` | A clock for the terminal. |
| `termux-api-shims` | The `termux-clipboard-get`, `termux-notification`, `termux-toast`, `termux-battery-status` and other Termux:API commands, working without the Termux:API app. See "The termux-api commands" below. |

The wallpaper-matching oh-my-posh prompt theme and the Neovim colour scheme are set up from
Settings › Look now, not from tlstore.

Ask about any one of them first with `tlstore info <name>`.

Names you see inside a `Needs` line — `fisher`, `musl-loader`, `config-fish` and the rest — are
parts, not choices. They come in with the item that needs them, and `tlstore install` refuses them
by name.

## Commands

| command | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `tlstore list` | everything in the store; a `*` marks what you already have |
| `tlstore list -i` | only what you have installed |
| `tlstore list -a` | only what you do not have yet |
| `tlstore search fish` | find an item by name or description |
| `tlstore info fish-shell` | what an item is, its version, and where it goes |
| `tlstore install kitten sigye` | install one or more items by name |
| `tlstore install` | open the picker instead of naming anything |
| `tlstore install --dry-run kitten` | show what would be installed, parts and build tools included, and change nothing |
| `tlstore remove kitten` | remove an item tlstore installed |
| `tlstore remove --dry-run kitten` | show what would be removed, and which files, and change nothing |
| `tlstore update` | bring everything you have up to date |
| `tlstore update --check` | see what is out of date without installing anything (`--dry-run` means the same) |
| `tlstore update --offline` | update from the item list you already have, without fetching a newer one |
| `tlstore refresh` | update the list of items without touching what is installed |
| `tlstore display` | set up graphics for Linux apps |
| `tlstore doctor` | check that everything is in place |
| `tlstore self-update` | bring tlstore itself up to date (`--check` only says) |
| `tlstore help` | the list of commands; `tlstore help install` or `tlstore install --help` is one command's own page |
| `tlstore version` | show the tlstore and item-list versions |
| `tlstore readme kitten` | print where a copy of the item's own README has been saved, fetching it when it is missing or a day old |
| `tlstore readme-asset kitten docs/shot.png` | print where a picture that README refers to has been saved, fetching it the same way |
| `--tsv` | on `list`, `search`, `info` and `update --check`: the same answer as tab-separated columns, for a program to read |

`-y` says yes to everything except a config file of yours, and goes before or after the command
(`tlstore -y install kitten`). `--configs` on `install` and `update` answers that one too, for
scripts. `add`, `uninstall` and `upgrade` are other names for `install`, `remove` and `update`.

An exit status of 0 means done, 1 means something failed and 2 means a mistake in what you typed.
`tlstore shell` is gone; it is now `tlstore install fish-shell`.

Removing a package-based item only tells tlstore to stop tracking it — the package itself stays
installed, the way `apt`/`pacman` already manage it. Everything else tlstore put down is deleted.

## Your config files are never replaced silently

When tlstore is about to write a config file you already have and yours is different, it shows you
the change and asks:

```
$ tlstore update
config-fish
--- /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.config/fish/config.fish
+++ ...
@@ -12,7 +12,7 @@
-    set -gx EDITOR vi
+    set -gx EDITOR nvim
Replace your config.fish? [y/N]
```

The answer defaults to no, and `-y` does not answer it — a config file is your work, not part of
"yes to everything". Answering yes leaves a timestamped backup of your file right beside it.

Either answer is remembered at the shipped version, so declining once is not asked about again
until that file itself changes. `tlstore update --check` lists those as *has a new version; update
shows the change and asks*. In a script, or anywhere there is nobody to ask, your file is kept and
one line says so — add `--configs` if you want the new one.

A few files are only ever installed once and then left alone for you to edit for good: your
personal fish settings and the fastfetch layout.

## Tools that are only needed while installing

Some items need a package only while they install and never again. `tlstore list` says so under the
item:

```
  claude-code    Anthropic's Claude Code, about 200 MB.
    needs while installing: patchelf
```

Tlstore installs those for you, and once everything is in place it offers to take back exactly the
ones it added and clear what it downloaded. Say no and they simply stay.

## The fish setup

`tlstore install fish-shell` installs fish itself, the launcher's
`config.fish`, a `conf.d/personal.fish` that is yours to edit, the `oh-my-posh` package, `eza`,
`zoxide`, and [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) with two plugins:

- [`puffer-fish`](https://github.com/nickeb96/puffer-fish) — type `...` and get `../..`, and other
  small text expansions.
- [`autopair.fish`](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/autopair.fish) — brackets and quotes close
  themselves.

Fisher fetches those plugins from GitHub itself, so installing them needs a network connection.
Keeping them current is fisher's job rather than tlstore's — `tlstore update` leaves them alone,
and `fisher update` in a fish shell brings them forward.

The wallpaper-matching prompt theme itself, and a matching Neovim colour scheme, come from
Settings › Look's "Tools that follow the terminal colours" instead of tlstore.

## The termux-api commands

`tlstore install termux-api-shims` puts the familiar Termux:API commands in `~/.local/bin`:
`termux-clipboard-get`, `termux-clipboard-set`, `termux-notification`, `termux-notification-remove`,
`termux-notification-list`, `termux-toast`, `termux-vibrate`, `termux-torch`,
`termux-battery-status`, `termux-volume` and `termux-wallpaper`. They print what the originals
print (plain text for the clipboard, JSON with the same field names for the battery, the volumes
and the notification list) and take the same options, so scripts written for Termux:API run
unchanged — no companion app needed, only this launcher.

Options the launcher cannot honour (notification buttons and actions, sounds, LED colours, toast
colours and position) are accepted and skipped with a one-line warning on stderr. When the launcher
is not running, or `launcherctl` is not on the path, the commands exit non-zero and say why.

The real Termux:API package provides the same commands, so tlstore refuses to install the shims
while it is there and tells you to remove it first (`pkg uninstall termux-api`). `termux-wallpaper`
needs a launcher build with `launcherctl wallpaper`.

## Where things go

Everything tlstore installs lives under `~/.local` — programs in `~/.local/bin`, larger tools in
`~/.local/lib` — never in Termux's own `bin`. That way a bootstrap reinstall, which wipes Termux's
own directories, never takes your tools with it, and tlstore never fights `apt`/`pacman` over a
name they already own. Configs go where the program that reads them expects, under `~/.config`.

## Keeping things up to date

`tlstore update` checks for a newer list of items, then upgrades anything you have that has moved
on. `tlstore refresh` only fetches that list, without installing or changing anything.

The list of items is signed by the launcher's maintainer, and tlstore only accepts an update to it
when the signature checks out and it is genuinely newer than the one you have — so a compromised
mirror or a bad network cannot swap in something else under your feet.

## Doctor

`tlstore doctor` looks over your setup — where things are installed, whether your shell finds them
before Termux's own copies, which tools tlstore's items need, and whether anything it installed has
gone missing — and tells you what, if anything, needs attention.

## Claude Code

`tlstore install claude-code` installs Claude Code. It is about 200 MB, downloaded from npm and run
through a small compatibility loader so it works on Android. Its own built-in updater is switched
off — `tlstore update` is how it gets new versions. Once it is installed, sign in by running:

```sh
claude
```

## Codex

`tlstore install codex` installs Codex, OpenAI's coding agent for the terminal. OpenAI's own Linux
build cannot reach the network on Android, so this is the Android build from
[codex-termux](https://github.com/DioNanos/codex-termux), Davide A. Guglielmi's port; the credit for
making it run on a phone is theirs. It is about 275 MB, downloaded from npm. Its own update check is
switched off — `tlstore update` is how it gets new versions. Once it is installed, sign in with:

```sh
codex
```

## opencode

`tlstore install opencode` installs [opencode](https://opencode.ai), another coding agent for the
terminal. It is about 200 MB, downloaded from npm and run through the same compatibility loader as
Claude Code. Its own updater is switched off — `tlstore update` is how it gets new versions. Once it
is installed, pick a provider and sign in with:

```sh
opencode
```

## btop

`tlstore install btop` installs [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop), the resource monitor,
in a form that sees the whole phone rather than just your own processes: the launcher runs it as
Android's shell user through [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app), so Shizuku has to be running and
Termux:Launcher granted in it, or `btop` says the lane isn't there and stops. What you get is every
process, the real disks and the network graphs; what you cannot do from there is kill or renice a
process (the shell user may look, not touch), so those keys are gone from btop's menus. Network
counters come from `/proc/net/dev`, since Android keeps the usual `/sys` files from the shell user.
It is a launcher item, not offered in plain Termux.

## Writing

`tlstore install dawn` installs [dawn](https://github.com/andrewmd5/dawn), a writing pad that runs
in the terminal. Open a file with `dawn notes.md`, or `dawn` on its own for an empty one. What you
type stays plain markdown on disk, but headings grow, links and quotes settle back, and a picture
you point at appears in place. In the launcher, copy and paste share the phone's clipboard.

Press `Ctrl+/` to ask the launcher's AI about what you are writing, have it rewrite the text you
selected, or write at the cursor; `Ctrl+Z` undoes anything it changes. It uses the model you chose
as the default in the launcher's AI settings.

It looks its best in the launcher's terminal, which is where the large headings and the pictures
come from; in a terminal without them, the same text is simply shown plain.

## On official Termux

Termux Launcher puts tlstore in place for you, but you do not need the launcher to use it — on
plain Termux, one command installs it:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PickleHik3/tlstore/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

It checks what it downloads before installing anything, and puts tlstore exactly where the
launcher app would: the `tlstore` command in your Termux `bin`, with the shorter `tl` and `tls`
where those names are still free, and its item list alongside it. `tlstore update` keeps tlstore
itself current from there, the same way it keeps your installed items current — you never need to
run the command above again. If you install Termux Launcher later, the app quietly takes over
keeping tlstore up to date. If you already have the launcher, running this command does nothing —
it already provides tlstore.

Inside the launcher, the store keeps itself current in plain view: when a newer tlstore is out,
plain `tlstore` opens on its Installing screen for `tlstore` itself, and once that is done the
new store opens on its own with a one-line "tlstore updated to …" notice. Backing out of that
screen stops the update, and the store you had goes on as before.

## Plain `tlstore`

Inside the launcher, running `tlstore` with nothing after it opens the store in a window of its
own. Anywhere else — plain Termux, ssh, tmux — it just prints the list, the same as `tlstore list`,
with one line on how to install something.

The store is one list. The item under the cursor fills the top of the screen: its picture, its
name, one line on what it is for, and its version, licence and author. Move with the arrow keys or
tap a row to look at it; press `⏎`, or tap it again, to open it. An open item shows its own README
from GitHub, laid out for the screen, and scrolls with a finger or the arrow keys. `i` installs,
`r` removes, `u` updates (or, on the list, shows only what has an update; `u` again updates them
all), `␣` picks several items at once, `s` stars the project on GitHub when `gh` is signed in,
`o` opens its page, `f` puts the launcher's keyboard away while you browse, `esc` goes back and `q`
quits. While something installs you can leave the screen; the row keeps showing where it got to,
and the phone gets a notice when it is done. Set `TLSTORE_MOTION=0` to turn the transitions off.

## Which app you are in

The store runs in the launcher and in plain Termux, and a few items only make sense in one of
them. `fastfetch` is a launcher item: its animated logo needs the launcher's terminal. So is
`btop`: it runs through the launcher's Shizuku lane. Everything else — `claude-code`, `codex`,
`dawn`, `opencode`, `sigye`, `kitten`, `fish-shell` — is offered in both.

An item that belongs to one of them is filtered out completely everywhere else: it is not listed,
not found by a search, and `tlstore info` says it is not in the list. `tlstore doctor` prints an
`App` line naming what tlstore thinks it is running in.

tlstore works this out from the environment the launcher sets, and, when a session came in over
ssh and carries nothing, from the file the app writes each time it starts. Set `TLSTORE_HOST` to
`launcher` or `termux` to say it yourself.

For maintainers: the option is `host=launcher`, `host=termux`, or a comma list; an item without it
is offered everywhere. `min-launcher=X.Y.Z` hides an item from launchers older than that version,
and is ignored where there is no launcher to compare against.

## References

`dawn`, `fastfetch`, `kitten`, `sigye`, and the musl runtime are built by the launcher's maintainer
rather than coming from Termux's own packages or npm. The binaries themselves are published at
[PickleHik3/tlstore](https://github.com/PickleHik3/tlstore),
which is what `tlstore install` downloads and checks against a pinned digest. The recipes that
build them from upstream source — with whatever patches are applied — live in that same repository
under `recipes/cross` and `recipes/termux`; run one
yourself to reproduce a binary and compare it against what tlstore installed.

Everything else in the store is unmodified: `claude-code`, `opencode` and `codex` (the codex-termux package) come straight from npm,
and the packages behind `fish-shell` (`fish`, `eza`, `zoxide`, `oh-my-posh`) come straight from Termux's
own package repository.

## For maintainers

The catalog that `tlstore` reads (`dist/catalog.tsv`, in the `PickleHik3/tlstore` repository) is
generated — never hand-edit it. To add or change an item, see `docs/maintainer/catalog.md` in that
repository for the full workflow; in short:

1. Edit `scripts/items.tsv`, the hand-maintained item list.
2. Run `scripts/build-catalog.sh` to compute digests, bump the serial, and write
   `dist/catalog.tsv`. A plain `http(s)` source is downloaded once to hash it, so that step needs
   the network; it must name a tag or a commit, never a branch.
3. Cut a release with `scripts/release.sh <tag>` (two passes: `--prepare`, then `bash
   scripts/sign.sh` by hand, then the plain form) to sign `dist/catalog.tsv` and `dist/tlstore`
   and record the new digests.
4. Commit `items.tsv`; the tagged `dist/` and `SHA256SUMS` are what `release.sh` writes.

Anything a user should not choose directly gets `hidden=1` in its options; anything needed only
while installing goes in `build=`. A file in this repository is pinned to a tag or the commit that
last changed it, so the catalog and the payload can never drift apart.

An item whose payload differs per launcher edition (a build linked against one edition's prefix, an
edition-specific binary) gets one row per edition, sharing a name but each with its own source and
digest — never one row trying to serve every edition.
